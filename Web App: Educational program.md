<h1>Educational Management Software for "Liceo Sinai" Costa Rica</h1>

<span>My role: Full stack software engineer</span>
<br>
<p>
This was a wonderful project I developed for a high school in Costa Rica. This institution has an educational program called the "International Baccalaureate." This type of program is complex because it includes multiple types and methods of grading.
I developed software that allowed them to manage the different types of assessments, as well as keep attendance records and many other features.

The system took two years to develop; it was implemented in 2018 and is still in use today.

The school was so pleased that they asked me to develop two more applications.
